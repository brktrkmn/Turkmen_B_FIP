# Burak Turkmen Midterm Project

## All about our product
This midterm project is about creating 2 of the 5 pages website for the Final Integrated Project.

The project web page consists of the mashup of two brands:
- BECK'S Beer
- Snuggle Fabric Refresher

The name and label information from BECK’S is being replaced by the name and text elements of Snuggle.
The overall style/branding will be that of ‘BECK’S beer but will communicate 'Snuggle' information/text.

## Requirements
Using Terminal, Git and Github, project structure has been created as following:

- assets folder
- css folder
- images folder
- includes folder
- js folder
- index.html
- responsibility.html
- readme.md

All files have been included in the correct folders.
Repository has been linked.
